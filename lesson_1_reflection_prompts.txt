How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Diff -u file1 file2

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Comparing different versions to find mistakes/ changes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: Don’t lose anything, changes would be saved instantly, we can save on each 
    logical change 
    Cons: Might make a mistake during editing and save the new incorrect version 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To allow to use or compare them later once we have decided to change something 
    or switch back to the all files’ versions on demand 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git diff 
    git log 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
